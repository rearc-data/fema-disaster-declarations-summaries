# OpenFEMA Dataset: Disaster Declarations Summaries - V2 | FEMA

The source code outlining how this product gathers, transforms, revises and publishes its datasets is available at [https://github.com/rearc-data/fema-disaster-declarations-summaries](https://github.com/rearc-data/fema-disaster-declarations-summaries).

## Main Overview
FEMA Disaster Declarations Summary is a summarized dataset describing all federally declared disasters. This dataset lists all official FEMA Disaster Declarations, beginning with the first disaster declaration in 1953 and features all three disaster declaration types: major disaster, emergency, and fire management assistance. The dataset includes declared recovery programs and geographic areas (county not available before 1964; Fire Management records are considered partial due to historical nature of the dataset).

Please note the unique structure of the disaster sequencing (due to a numbering system that originated in the 1950's-1970's):

| | |
|-|-|
| 0001-1999 | Major Disaster Declaration |
| 2000-2999 | Fire Management |
| 3000-3999 | Emergency Declaration (Special Emergency) |
| 4000- | Major Disaster Declaration |

This is raw, unedited data from FEMA's National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS) and as such is subject to a small percentage of human error. The dataset is primarily composed of historical data that was manually entered into NEMIS after it launched in 1998. The financial information is derived from NEMIS and not FEMA's official financial systems.

Due to differences in reporting periods, status of obligations, and how business rules are applied, this financial information may differ slightly from official publication on public websites such as usaspending.gov. This dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial reporting.
